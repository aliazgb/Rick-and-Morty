# Rick and Morty Character Search

This project allows users to search for and view details about characters from the Rick and Morty series. It fetches character data from the Rick and Morty API and displays key information, including the episodes they appear in. Users can also save their favourite characters for quick access later.

## Features
- Search for characters by name: Users can search for characters by typing in the search bar.
- View detailed character information: See character details, including gender, status, species, and last known location.
- View episodes: Each characterâ€™s episodes are listed with their names, air dates, and episode numbers.
- Add/remove characters from favourites: Users can add characters to their favourites for easy access and remove them later.
- Persistent state: Favourites are saved using localStorage, so users can access their favourites even after refreshing the page.
